# Expectation-Maximization-Algorithm-for-ImageSegmentation
Academic project which refers to implementation of EM Algorithm, with modified Gaussian Mixtures.
Then we apply the EM algorithm to segment the im.jpg image.

## Reconstruction Erros we got for different Ks
* Reconstruction error at K = 1 -->  0.17303304487093304
* Reconstruction error at K = 2 -->  0.09146756998180702
* Reconstruction error at K = 4 -->  0.053652006835015656
* Reconstruction error at K = 8 -->  0.03254491248255033
* Reconstruction error at K = 16 -->  0.024316967623008768
* Reconstruction error at K = 32 -->  0.016766211379170327
* Reconstruction error at K = 64 -->  0.013193268116753292
